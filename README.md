# Solidity Learning Journey

This repository contains Solidity smart contract examples and projects that I'm working on as part of my ongoing learning process. The code and examples here are based on my experience with various courses and resources that I’m currently exploring.

## Courses & Resources

### 1. [Alchemy University: Solidity Bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com/course/solidity/md/64efd90f0fabbc0002f40590)
I'm currently working through this course, which provides a solid foundation in Solidity. As I progress through the lessons, I’ll be adding new files and smart contract examples to this repository, reflecting the concepts I’ve learned and practiced.

### 2. [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/hello-world/)
This is an excellent resource that provides clear, hands-on Solidity examples. I'm using this as a reference to better understand specific aspects of Solidity while working on my own smart contracts.

### 3. [Cyfrin's Updraft: Solidity Course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/solidity)
This course seems like a great follow-up resource, and I plan to explore it soon to further enhance my knowledge of Solidity and smart contract development.
